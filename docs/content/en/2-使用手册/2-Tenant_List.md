#### 2. Tenant Details
> Administrators can view and edit tenant details, including the number of users associated with the tenant, allocated resources, and more.

#### 3. Tenant List
> The list displays all the tenants within the platform. Administrators can manage tenants by editing or removing them as necessary.

#### 4. Tenant Roles
> Each tenant can have multiple roles assigned to different users within the tenant. Administrators can configure these roles from this module.

#### 5. Delete a Tenant
> Administrators can delete a tenant from the platform. Deleting a tenant will remove all associated data, so proceed with caution.
